# Rover Bot, Hands-On Competition 2013 @ Intec

This is the code for the Rover Bot that won first place at [INTEC's](https://www.intec.edu.do/) Hands-On Competition of Fall 2013.

The purpose of the competition was to build a robot that could follow a black line on top of a white track, grab a box at the end, bring it back to the starting line and position it baed on its based on color.

The hardware consisted of an Arduino Microcontroller powered by a 9V battery, DC motors for the wheels, servo motors for the hand, and infrared sensors as the input signals.

The algorithm itself was a [PID Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) implementation written in C that turned out to work better than expected and exceeded expectations. [Check the original, working, unmodified code here](./RoverBot.c). A variation of the following formula was used to calculate the output in the form of an integer number that would then to the motors and control the direction.
